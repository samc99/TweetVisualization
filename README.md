This map contains the location of all the tweets filtered by the keyword 'asian' in the period of 60 seconds. By using the tweepy library and stream.listener function in python, we successfully crawls all the tweets within the contiguous USA.

The broad search term does not reveal much about 'asian' or 'asian' people', but what the results entails is the distribution of people who have internet access in the United States. What is obvious is that the coastal area and urban area contain higher population density than the rural areas.
